a partial native EPS security context is taken into use through a security mode control procedure
The EPS security context is taken into use by the UE and the MME
the MME initiates a security mode control procedure
The MME initiates the NAS security mode control procedure
the MME and the UE create an EPS security context using null integrity and null ciphering algorithm during an attach procedure for emergency bearer services, or a tracking area updating procedure for a UE that has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services
A partial native EPS security context is established in the UE and the network
 an EPS authentication is successfully performed
 The network initiates the authentication procedure
 the network has established secure exchange of NAS messages for the NAS signalling connection
 Secure exchange of NAS messages via a NAS signalling connection is usually established by the MME
